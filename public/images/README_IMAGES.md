Place four images you want to display in the hero grid here.

Filenames expected by the app (replace with your files):
- photo1.jpg
- photo2.jpg
- photo3.jpg
- photo4.jpg

Supported formats: .jpg, .png, .webp

If an image is missing, the app will fall back to `/public/placeholder.svg` (already present in the project).
